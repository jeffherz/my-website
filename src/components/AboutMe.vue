<h1>Why am I?</h1>
<p>I started off wanting to rehab the world and go into physical therapy.  Then I had a realization that 
    I could do more with less than 8 years or education.  I coulde be a software developer.  I decided to enroll
    at Tech Elevator, hoping to get a jumpstart on software development.  After 14 week, I realized,
    I can actually do this.  So here I am, making it in the world creating my personal website... Hell yeah!!!
