<h1>Why am I?</h1>
<p>I started off wanting to rehab the world and go into physical therapy.  Then I had a realization that 
    I could do more with less than 8 years or education.  I coulde be a software developer.  I decided to enroll
    at Tech Elevator, hoping to get a jumpstart on software development.  After 14 week, I realized,
    I can actually do this.  So here I am, making it in the world creating my personal website... Hell yeah!!!

<h1>Past Experience</h1>
<p>From November of 2020 to March 2021, I got the opportunity to be a academic fellow for a Tech Elevator cohort where I would help the students with their assignments, answer any questions that they might have, and assist the instructor with whatever they needed.  It was great getting to work with the students and change strategy with the different personalities and learning styles.
